# 🪙 DigitalChain

## 📖 Project Description
**DigitalChain** is a decentralized digital record management system built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows users to **store**, **verify**, and **retrieve immutable digital records** securely and transparently.  
Each record is timestamped and permanently stored, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision
To create a **trustless digital ledger** for certificates, documents, and digital proofs — eliminating the need for centralized authorities.  
DigitalChain aims to empower individuals and organizations by providing a **secure, transparent, and decentralized** way to manage digital assets.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔐 **Immutable Records:** All entries are stored permanently on the blockchain.  
- 🧾 **Verifiable Proofs:** Verify authenticity of records through unique data hashes.  
- ⏰ **Timestamped Entries:** Every record is stored with the exact time of submission.  
- 🌐 **Decentralized Access:** Publicly accessible and verifiable data with no intermediaries.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- 🪙 **NFT Integration:** Represent digital records as NFTs for unique digital ownership.  
- ☁️ **IPFS Support:** Store metadata and file hashes using decentralized storage solutions.  
- 🧩 **Web3 Frontend:** Build a user-friendly DApp interface for easy interaction.  
- 🧠 **AI Verification:** Implement AI-powered validation for document authenticity.

---

## 🧠 Smart Contract Summary
- **addRecord(string _dataHash):** Add a new digital record with a unique hash (e.g., IPFS or SHA-256).  
- **verifyRecord(uint256 _id):** Retrieve and verify a specific record by ID.  
- **getRecordCount():** Get the total number of records stored in the contract.
